ðŸ“Š Predicting household energy consumption using machine learning models

ðŸ“Œ Overview
PowerPulse is a machine learning project that forecasts household energy usage using various models:
âœ… Linear Regression
âœ… Random Forest
âœ… Gradient Boosting
âœ… Neural Networks

The models are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
